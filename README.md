Zybo Examples
========

This repo contains what I learn from Zybo Board and some examples for my blog tutorial.

(All tutorial written in Traditional Chinese since I write for Taiwanese.)

## How to use these examples

First you need at least `Vivado 2016.1` , after open the project, you may need to re-generate the bitstream or the binary by follow my blog tutorials.

## Examples

- [LED flash via PL](https://github.com/coldnew/zybo-examples/tree/master/led_flash_pl)

An example to only use programmable logic to make the led flash.
